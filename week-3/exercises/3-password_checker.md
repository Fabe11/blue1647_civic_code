# Password Checker

What you will use: HTML, jQuery

Create a form that collects a person's first name, last name, email and password. Once a person
clicks the "Submit" button, using jQuery, display a message about how secure their password is
(if the passwords is longer than 8 charactes, it is secure enough).

What you will need to research(meaning Google for):
- how to create a HTML form
- how to select a HTML element
- how to gather data from a form once it is submitted
- how to display a something on a HTML page using jQuery 

If you are using JS Fiddle, include jQuery from the top right drop down menu. If you are working locally on a .js file, ask an instructor how to include the jQuery library in your project.
